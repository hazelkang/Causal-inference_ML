What is Machine Learning?
  Alan Turing(1950s): father of theoretical Computer Science, AI
  "Can machines think?" "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?" 
  Subset of Artificial Intelligence, improve performance at a task through "experience"
  Predict future from the past

  Traditionally, software engineering combined human-created rules with data to create answers to a problem 
  Instead of that, ML uses data and answers to discover the rules behind a problem
  
Terminology
  Example Data x, Target Response f(x), y
  Target response: a specific feature in the dataset you'd like to predict
  
Types of ML
1) Supervised learning
2) Unsupervised learning
3) Semi-supervised learning
4) Reinforcement learning

*Supervised learning
: example data, target response all present; know the link btw the two 
-similar to human learning under the supervision of a teacher 

*Unsupervised learning
: example data without any associated response, leaving algorithm to determine data patterns on its own
-recommendation system

*Semi-supervised learning
: partially labeled data sets
-supervised learning requires dataset to be labeled : costly process
-unsupervised learning: disadvantage of limited application spectrum 

*Reinforcement learning
: algorithm learns from example data along with positive/negative feedback to each prediction the algorithm proposes 
: learning by trial and error / stock market

1) Supervised learning
: training examples (x,y) for an unknown function f
: find a good approximation of function f which can be used for prediction if x is known 
-Based on data type of the target responses, supervised learning can be split into
  1. Classification - for categorical data (no explicit order; colors)
  2. Regression - for continuous data (numerical, explicit order involved)
  
--Supervised learning examples
1. Situation without human expert
2. Situation where humans can perform the task but cannot describe how they do it (handwritten character)
3. Desired function changes frequently(stock prices)
4. Each user needs a customized function f
