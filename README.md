CODED using Chernozhukov (2018) paper to print 

- Based on Python Codes in below site by Paul Schrimpf, reformulated codes that replicated the results in Chernozhukov(2018) paper.

-The results print:

1) Stage 1: Best Linear Predictor(BLP) of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using 4 machine learning techniques
-> Elastic Net, Boosted Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest

2) Stage 2: Sorted Group Average Treatment Effects (GATES): 20% most, 20% least affected groups, difference

3) Stage 3: Classification Analysis (CLAN) or average characteristics of the most and least affected groups
